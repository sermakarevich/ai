    "**Debugging LLM Applications in LangChain**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Need for Debugging**: When building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), debugging is essential. Issues can arise from various points in the application including failed model calls, misformatted outputs, and errors in nested model calls.\n",
    "*   **Debugging Methods**: LangChain provides three primary methods for debugging:\n",
    "    *   **Verbose Mode**: Adds print statements for key events in a chain, offering a basic level of visibility.\n",
    "    *   **Debug Mode**: Adds logging statements for *all* events within a chain, providing comprehensive detail.\n",
    "    *  **LangSmith Tracing**: Logs events to LangSmith, allowing for visualisation and a deeper inspection of the application's inner workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Comparison of Debugging Methods**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature          | Verbose Mode | Debug Mode | LangSmith Tracing |\n",
    "| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **LangSmith Tracing**:\n",
    "    *   As applications become more complex with multiple steps and LLM calls, tracing becomes crucial to understand the behaviour of chains or agents.\n",
    "    *   LangSmith is the recommended tool for tracing.\n",
    "    *   To start logging traces, you need to sign up for LangSmith and set environment variables:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n",
    "        export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    *   In a notebook, environment variables can be set like this:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        import getpass\n",
    "        import os\n",
    "        os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\n",
    "        os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Example with an Agent**:\n",
    "    *   The sources demonstrates using an agent to answer a question about a movie director and their age.\n",
    "    *   Without debugging, the output is limited.\n",
    "    *   With LangSmith enabled, detailed information about the agent's actions can be seen via a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Verbose Mode (`set_verbose(True)`)**:\n",
    "    *   For prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts, verbose mode is a good option for printing intermediate steps.\n",
    "    *   Setting the verbose flag will print inputs and outputs in a readable format, while skipping raw outputs like token usage statistics.\n",
    "    *   It still works with LangSmith, so both can be enabled simultaneously.\n",
    "    *   Verbose mode will print the calls to tools, including the input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Debug Mode (`set_debug(True)`)**:\n",
    "    *   Setting the debug flag will print inputs and outputs for all LangChain components (chains, models, agents, tools, retrievers).\n",
    "    *   This mode is very verbose and logs all raw inputs and outputs.\n",
    "    *   Debug mode prints all steps of the chain, from the initial input to the final output, as well as all intermediate steps.\n",
    "        * This includes the start and end of chain runs, prompt runs, LLM runs, tool runs, and parser runs.\n",
    "    *   It also shows the inputs and outputs of each component, including the prompts sent to the LLM and the results of tool calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Combining Debugging Methods**: It is possible to use LangSmith tracing alongside the local verbose or debug modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "    *   Debugging is essential when building LLM applications due to potential issues like failed model calls or misformatted outputs.\n",
    "    *  LangChain offers three main debugging methods: Verbose Mode, Debug Mode, and LangSmith Tracing.\n",
    "    *   LangSmith provides the most comprehensive debugging solution with a UI and persisted logs.\n",
    "    *   Verbose mode prints key events in a chain, while debug mode provides full logging of all components.\n",
    "    *  These debugging methods can be used in combination to provide a comprehensive view of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary provides an overview of how to debug LLM applications in LangChain, drawing on the information in the sources, and our conversation history. It covers the key debugging methods, their features, and how they can be used to troubleshoot issues in your applications.\n"
