    "Here's an extensive summary in markdown format, drawing on the provided sources, our conversation history, and with some bolding to highlight key concepts related to asynchronous programming in LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asynchronous Programming with LangChain**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **I/O-Bound Operations:** Many language model applications involve numerous I/O-bound operations such as API calls to language models, databases, or other services.\n",
    "*   **Asynchronous Programming**: This paradigm allows programs to execute multiple tasks concurrently without blocking other tasks, which is particularly useful in I/O-bound scenarios, improving both efficiency and responsiveness.\n",
    "*   **Prerequisites**: It is expected that users have a foundational understanding of asynchronous programming in Python before working with LangChain in an asynchronous context. This guide focuses specifically on how to use LangChain in async contexts, assuming prior knowledge of asynchronous programming.\n",
    "*   **LangChain Asynchronous APIs:** Many LangChain APIs are designed to be asynchronous, which allows developers to build efficient and responsive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Asynchronous Counterparts**: Methods that perform I/O operations typically have an asynchronous counterpart.\n",
    "*   **\"a\" Prefix**: In LangChain, asynchronous methods have an \"a\" prefix and are located in the same classes as their synchronous counterparts. For instance, the asynchronous version of the `invoke` method is `ainvoke`.\n",
    "*   **Runnable Interface**: Many LangChain components implement the Runnable Interface, which includes support for asynchronous execution. This means Runnables can be run asynchronously using the `await` keyword.\n",
    "    *   Example: `await some_runnable.ainvoke(some_input)`\n",
    "*   **Non-Runnable Components**: Components that do not implement the Runnable Interface, such as Embedding Models and Vector Stores, typically still have asynchronous versions of their methods with an \"a\" prefix, like `await some_vectorstore.aadd_documents(documents)`.\n",
    "*   **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**: Runnables created using LCEL can also be run asynchronously due to their implementation of the full Runnable Interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delegation to Synchronous Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Default Implementation**: When a native asynchronous implementation is not available, LangChain tries to provide a default implementation, even if this incurs a slight overhead.\n",
    "*  **Asyncio Executor**: By default, LangChain delegates the execution of unimplemented asynchronous methods to their synchronous counterparts, treating them as blocking operations that should be run in a separate thread. This is achieved through `asyncio.loop.run_in_executor`, which uses a thread pool executor that is reused within the given event loop.\n",
    "*   **Slight Overhead**: This delegation strategy introduces a slight overhead due to context switching between threads but guarantees that every asynchronous method has a default working implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Minimal Overhead**: Async code in LangChain generally performs well with minimal overhead and is unlikely to be a bottleneck for most applications.\n",
    "*   **Main Sources of Overhead**:\n",
    "    1.  **Context Switching**: The cost of context switching between threads when delegating to synchronous methods, which can be addressed by providing a native asynchronous implementation.\n",
    "    2.  **LCEL \"Cheap Functions\"**: In LCEL, cheap functions are scheduled as tasks on the event loop (if they are async) or run in a separate thread (if they are sync), rather than being run inline.\n",
    "*   **Latency Overhead**: The expected latency overhead is between tens of microseconds to a few milliseconds.\n",
    "*   **Blocking the Event Loop**: A common source of performance issues arises from accidentally blocking the event loop by calling synchronous code in an asynchronous context (e.g., using `invoke` instead of `ainvoke`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compatibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **asyncio Library**: LangChain is only compatible with the `asyncio` library, which is distributed as part of the Python standard library. It does not support other async libraries like `trio` or `curio`.\n",
    "*   **Python 3.9 and 3.10 Issues**: In Python versions 3.9 and 3.10, asyncio tasks did not accept a `context` parameter. This limitation can prevent LangChain from automatically propagating the `RunnableConfig` down the call chain in certain scenarios.\n",
    "*   **Streaming, Callbacks, Tracing Issues**: If issues with streaming, callbacks, or tracing are encountered in asynchronous code while using Python 3.9 or 3.10, the lack of context propagation is a likely cause.\n",
    "*   **Resolution**: To resolve this, you can either manually propagate the `RunnableConfig` down the call chain or upgrade to Python 3.11, where this issue no longer exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in IPython and Jupyter Notebooks**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Asynchronous REPL Support**: As of IPython 7.0, IPython supports asynchronous REPLs. This enables the use of the `await` keyword in the IPython REPL and Jupyter Notebooks without additional configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Asynchronous programming in LangChain enhances the efficiency and responsiveness of applications by enabling concurrent task execution.\n",
    "*   Asynchronous methods in LangChain typically have an “a” prefix (e.g., `ainvoke`).\n",
    "*   LangChain attempts to provide a default implementation for asynchronous methods, even if it involves delegating to synchronous counterparts through a thread pool.\n",
    "*   While generally efficient, performance issues can arise if synchronous code is accidentally used in an asynchronous context, blocking the event loop.\n",
    "*   LangChain is only compatible with the asyncio library, with some specific issues in Python 3.9 and 3.10 related to context propagation.\n",
