    "Here's an extensive summary in markdown format, drawing on the provided sources, our conversation history, and with some bolding to highlight key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callbacks in LangChain**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** LangChain provides a callback system that allows you to hook into various stages of your Language Model (LLM) application.\n",
    "*   **Use Cases:** This system is useful for a range of tasks such as logging, monitoring, and streaming.\n",
    "*  **Subscription to Events:** You can subscribe to different events by using the `callbacks` argument available throughout the LangChain API. This argument takes a list of handler objects.\n",
    "*  **Handler Objects:** Handler objects are expected to implement one or more of the methods described in the callback events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callback Events**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Event Triggers:** Callbacks are triggered by specific events that occur during the execution of a LangChain application.\n",
    "*   **Associated Methods**: Each event is associated with a specific method that callback handlers implement.\n",
    "*   **Types of Events:** LangChain provides a variety of callback events, including:\n",
    "    *   **Model Events**:\n",
    "        *   `on_chat_model_start`: When a chat model starts.\n",
    "        *   `on_llm_start`: When an LLM starts.\n",
    "        *   `on_llm_new_token`: When an LLM or chat model emits a new token.\n",
    "        *   `on_llm_end`: When an LLM or chat model ends.\n",
    "        *   `on_llm_error`: When an LLM or chat model errors.\n",
    "    *   **Chain Events**:\n",
    "        *   `on_chain_start`: When a chain starts running.\n",
    "        *   `on_chain_end`: When a chain ends.\n",
    "        *   `on_chain_error`: When a chain errors.\n",
    "    *   **Tool Events**:\n",
    "        *    `on_tool_start`: When a tool starts running.\n",
    "        *    `on_tool_end`: When a tool ends.\n",
    "        *    `on_tool_error`: When a tool errors.\n",
    "    *   **Agent Events**:\n",
    "        *   `on_agent_action`: When an agent takes an action.\n",
    "        *  `on_agent_finish`: When an agent ends.\n",
    "    *   **Retriever Events**:\n",
    "         *  `on_retriever_start`: When a retriever starts.\n",
    "         *   `on_retriever_end`: When a retriever ends.\n",
    "         *   `on_retriever_error`: When a retriever errors.\n",
    "    *   **Other Events**:\n",
    "        *   `on_text`: When arbitrary text is run.\n",
    "        *   `on_retry`: When a retry event is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callback Handlers**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Synchronous and Asynchronous Handlers**: Callback handlers can be either synchronous or asynchronous.\n",
    "    *   **Sync Handlers**: Implement the `BaseCallbackHandler` interface.\n",
    "    *   **Async Handlers**: Implement the `AsyncCallbackHandler` interface.\n",
    "*   **Callback Manager**: LangChain uses a callback manager (either `CallbackManager` or `AsyncCallbackManager`) to call the appropriate method on each registered callback handler when an event is triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Passing Callbacks**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Availability**: The `callbacks` property is available on most objects in the API (Models, Tools, Agents, etc.).\n",
    "*   **Two Methods**: Callbacks can be passed in two different ways:\n",
    "    *   **Request Time Callbacks**:\n",
    "        *   Passed at the time of the request along with the input data.\n",
    "        *   Available on all standard `Runnable` objects.\n",
    "        *   **Inherited**: These callbacks are inherited by all children of the object they are defined on.\n",
    "        *   **Example**: `chain.invoke({\"number\": 25}, {\"callbacks\": [handler]})`.\n",
    "    *   **Constructor Callbacks**:\n",
    "        *   Passed as arguments to the constructor of the object.\n",
    "        *   **Scoped**: These callbacks are scoped only to the object they are defined on.\n",
    "        *   **Not Inherited**: They are **not** inherited by any children of the object.\n",
    "        *   **Example**: `chain = TheNameOfSomeChain(callbacks=[handler])`.\n",
    "*   **Important Note**: If you create a custom chain or runnable, you need to propagate request time callbacks to any child objects.\n",
    "*   **Async in Python <=3.10**: If using `RunnableLambda`, `RunnableGenerator`, or `Tool` that invokes other runnables, and running asynchronously in Python 3.10 or earlier, you **must** propagate callbacks manually to child objects. LangChain cannot automatically propagate callbacks in these cases. This can lead to events not being emitted from custom runnables or tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   LangChain's callback system allows you to monitor and interact with the different stages of your LLM application.\n",
    "*   Callbacks are triggered by specific events, and you can implement handlers for these events to perform logging, monitoring, and other tasks.\n",
    "*  Callbacks can be passed either at request time (inherited by children) or via the constructor (scoped to the object).\n",
    "*  When building custom chains and using asynchronous features in Python 3.10 or earlier, you must propagate callbacks manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary provides a comprehensive overview of callbacks in LangChain, covering their purpose, how they work, the types of events available, the different types of handlers, how to pass callbacks, and key considerations for working with them, drawing on the information in the provided sources.\n"
