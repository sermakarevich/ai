    "Here's an extensive summary in markdown format, drawing on the provided sources, our conversation history, and with some bolding to highlight key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Parsers**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose**: Output parsers are designed to take the text output from a model and transform it into a more structured representation. They are useful when working with LLMs to generate structured data, or to normalise output from chat models and LLMs.\n",
    "*  **Function Calling**: It is generally recommended to use function or tool calling rather than output parsing, as more models are supporting this functionality which handles the structuring of data automatically.\n",
    "*   **Variety**: LangChain supports a variety of output parsers, each with unique characteristics.\n",
    "    *   **Name**: The name of the output parser.\n",
    "    *   **Supports Streaming**: Indicates if the parser supports streaming.\n",
    "    *   **Has Format Instructions**: Indicates if the parser has format instructions, this is generally available unless the schema is not specified in the prompt, or when the parser wraps another parser.\n",
    "    *  **Calls LLM**: Indicates if the output parser itself calls an LLM, typically done to correct misformatted output.\n",
    "    *   **Input Type**: The expected input type.\n",
    "    *   **Output Type**: The output type of the object returned by the parser.\n",
    "    *   **Description**: Commentary on the parser and when to use it.\n",
    "*   **Specific Output Parsers**:\n",
    "    *   **String Parser**: Parses texts from message objects, useful for handling variable formats of message content.\n",
    "    *   **JSON Parser**: Returns a JSON object as specified and is the most reliable for getting structured data that doesn't use function calling. It can also return JSON for a specified Pydantic model.\n",
    "    *   **XML Parser**: Returns a dictionary of tags, for use when XML output is needed with models that are good at writing XML, such as Anthropic models.\n",
    "    *   **CSV Parser**: Returns a list of comma separated values.\n",
    "    *   **OutputFixing Parser**: Wraps another output parser. If that parser errors, then this parser will pass the error message and the bad output to an LLM and ask it to fix it.\n",
    "    *   **RetryWithError Parser**: Wraps another output parser. If that parser errors, then this parser will pass the original inputs, the bad output, and the error message to an LLM and ask it to fix it. This parser also sends the original instructions, unlike the `OutputFixingParser`.\n",
    "    *   **Pydantic Parser**: Takes a user defined Pydantic model and returns data in that format.\n",
    "    *  **YAML Parser**: Takes a user defined Pydantic model and returns data in that format using YAML to encode it.\n",
    "    *   **PandasDataFrame Parser**: Useful for doing operations with pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "    *   **Enum Parser**: Parses response into one of the provided enum values.\n",
    "    *   **Datetime Parser**: Parses response into a datetime string.\n",
    "    *   **Structured Parser**: Returns structured information, but is less powerful than other output parsers since it only allows for fields to be strings. Useful when you are working with smaller LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Output parsers transform a model's text output into a more structured format, which is useful for generating structured data or normalising outputs.\n",
    "*   It is recommended to use function/tool calling over output parsing when possible.\n",
    "*   LangChain provides a range of output parsers, each suited to different tasks and output types.\n",
    "*   Specific parsers such as **JSON, XML, and CSV** cater to structured data needs, while others like **OutputFixing and RetryWithError** provide error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary covers the key aspects of output parsers, their purpose, types, and how they are used, drawing on the provided source material. It highlights the transition to using tool/function calling, and the different parsing options within LangChain, providing practical insights into when to use which type of parser.\n"
